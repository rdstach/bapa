> A work-in-progress: VanillaJS Clipboard API doesn't work well with WhatsApp.

My mom runs a WhatsApp group where a bunch of people report their reading progress on their bible, daily. These reports will then be gathered into a large message where it will show people's name and their reading status.

Since I was tired of doing it manually, I created a tool for it. _With the help of JavaScript_, the task that once took 15 mins could just be 30 seconds. **An automated world is lovely**.

This project started as a CLI written in Node.js. Because of it being a CLI, I rarely use it because I'm mostly on my phone at the end of the day. So one day, I decided to port it into a site. The app is now written in VanillaJS and are hosted on ZEIT's `now`.

You can see the old CLI app in the `nodejs` branch.
